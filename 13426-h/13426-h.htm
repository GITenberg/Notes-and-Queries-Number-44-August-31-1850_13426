<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>GRAVESEND BOATS.</h3>
<p>While so much has been said of coaches, in the early numbers of
"Notes and Queries" and elsewhere, very little notice has been
taken of another mode of conveyance which has now become very
important. I think it may amuse some of your readers to compare a
modern Gravesend boat and passage with the account given by Daniel
Defoe, in the year 1724: and as it is contained in what I believe
to be one of his least known works, it may probably be new to most
of them. In his <i>Great Law of Subordination</i>, after describing
the malpractices of hackney coachmen, he proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The next are the watermen; and, indeed, the insolence of these,
though they are under some limitations too, is yet such at this
time, that it stands in greater need than any other, of severe
laws, and those laws being put in speedy execution.</p>
<p>"Some years ago, one of these very people being steersman of a
passage-boat between London and Gravesend, drown'd three-and-fifty
people at one time. The boat was bound from Gravesend to London,
was very full of passengers and goods, and deep loaden. The wind
blew very hard at south-west, which being against them, obliged
them to turn to windward, so the seamen call it, when they tack
from side to side, to make their voyage against the wind by the
help of the tide.</p>
<p>"The passengers were exceedingly frighted when, in one tack
stretching over the stream, in a place call'd Long-Reach, where the
river is very broad, the waves broke in upon the boat, and not only
wetted them all, but threw a great deal of water into the boat, and
they all begg'd of the steersman or master not to venture again.
He, sawey and impudent, mock'd them, ask'd some of the poor
frighted women if they were afraid of going to the Devil; bid them
say their prayers and the like, and then stood over again, as it
were, in a jest. The storm continuing, he shipp'd a great deal of
water that time also. By this time the rest of the watermen begun
to perswade him, and told him, in short, that if he stood over
again the boat would founder, for that she was a great deal the
deeper for the water she had taken in, and one of them begg'd of
him not to venture; he swore at the fellow, call'd him fool, bade
him let him alone to his business, and he would warrant him; then
used a vulgar sea-proverb, which such fellows have in their mouths,
'Blow Devil, the more wind, the better boat.'</p>
<p>"The fellow told him in so many words he would drown all the
passengers, and before his face began to strip, and so did two
more, that they might be in condition to swim for their lives. This
extremely terrify'd the passengers, who, having a cloth or tilt
over them, were in no condition to save their lives, so that there
was a dreadful cry among them, and some of the men were making way
to come at the steersman to make him by force let fly the sail and
stand back for the shore; but before they could get to him the
waves broke in upon the boat and carried them all to the bottom,
none escaping but the three watermen that were prepar'd to
swim.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
"page210"></a>{210}</span>
<p>"It was but poor satisfaction for the loss of so many lives, to
say the steersman was drown'd with them, who ought, indeed, to have
died at the gallows, or on the wheel, for he was certainly the
murtherer of all the rest.</p>
<p>"I have many times pass'd between London and Gravesend with
these fellows in their smaller boats, when I have seen them, in
spite of the shrieks and cries of the women and the persuasions of
the men passengers, and, indeed, as if they were the more bold by
how much the passengers were the more afraid; I say, I have seen
them run needless hazards, and go, as it were, within an inch of
death, when they have been under no necessity of it, and, if not in
contempt of the passengers, it has been in meer laziness to avoid
their rowing; and I have been sometimes oblig'd, especially when
there has been more men in the boat of the same mind, so that we
have been strong enough for them, to threaten to cut their throats
to make them hand their sails and keep under shore, not to fright
as well as hazard the passengers when there was no need of it.</p>
<p>"One time, being in one of these boats all alone, coming from
London to Gravesend, the wind freshen'd and it begun to blow very
hard after I was come about three or four mile of the way; and as I
said above, that I always thought those fellows were the more
venturous when their passengers were the most fearful, I resolved I
would let this fellow alone to himself; so I lay down in the boat
as if I was asleep, as is usual.</p>
<p>"Just when I lay down, I called to the waterman, 'It blows hard,
waterman,' said I; 'can you swim?' 'No, Sir,' says he. 'Nor can't
your man swim neither?' said I. 'No, Sir,' says the servant. 'Well
then,' says I, 'take care of yourselves, I shall shift as well as
you, I suppose:' and so down I lay. However, I was not much
disposed to sleep; I kept the tilt which they cover their
passengers with open in one place, so that I could see how things
went.</p>
<p>"The wind was fair, but over-blow'd so much, that in those
reaches of the river which turn'd crossway, and where the wind by
consequence was thwart the stream, the water went very high, and we
took so much into the boat, that I began to feel the straw which
lay under me at the bottom was wet, so I call'd to the waterman,
and jesting told him, they must go all hands to the pump; he
answered, he hoped I should not be wet; 'But it's bad weather,
master,' says he, 'we can't help it.' 'No, no,' says I, ''tis
pretty well yet, go on.'</p>
<p>"By and by I heard him say to himself, 'It blows very hard,' and
every now and then he repeated it, and sometimes thus: ''Twill be a
dirty night, 'twill be a terrible night,' and the like; still I lay
still and said nothing.</p>
<p>"After some time, and his bringing out several such speeches as
above, I rous'd as if I had but just wak'd; 'Well, waterman,' says
I, 'how d'ye go on?' 'Very indifferently,' says he; 'it blows very
hard.' 'Ay, so it does,' says I; 'where are we?' 'A little above
Erith,' says he; so down I lay again, and said no more for that
time.</p>
<p>"By and by he was at it again, 'It blows a frett of wind,' and
'It blows very hard,' and the like; but still I said nothing. At
last we ship'd a dash of water over the boat's head, and the spry
of it wetted me a little, and I started up again as if I had been
asleep; 'Waterman,' says I, 'what are you doing? what, did you ship
a sea?' 'Ay,' says the waterman, 'and a great one too; why it blows
a frett of wind.' 'Well, well,' says I, 'come, have a good heart;
where are we now?' 'Almost in Gallions,' says he, 'that's a reach
below Woolwich.'</p>
<p>"Well, when we got into the Gallions reach, there the water was
very rough, and I heard him say to his man, 'Jack, we'll keep the
weather-shore aboard, for it grows dark and it blows a storm.' Ay,
thought I, had I desir'd you to stand in under shore, you would
have kept off in meer bravado; but I said nothing. By and by his
mast broke, and gave a great crack, and the fellow cry'd out, 'Lord
have mercy upon us!' I started up again, but still spoke
cheerfully; 'What's the matter now?' says I. 'L&mdash;d, Sir,'
say's he, 'how can you sleep? why my mast is come by the board.'
'Well, well,' says I, 'then you must take a goose-wing.' 'A
goose-wing! why,' says he, 'I can't carry a knot of sail, it blows
a storm.' 'Well,' says I, 'if you can't carry any sail, you must
drive up under shore then, you have the tide under foot:' and with
that I lay down again. The man did as I said. A piece of his mast
being yet standing, he made what they call a goose-wing sail, that
is, a little piece of the sail out, just to keep the boat steddy,
and with this we got up as high as Blackwall; the night being then
come on and very dark, and the storm increasing, I suffer'd myself
to be persuaded to put in there, though five or six mile short of
London; whereas, indeed, I was resolv'd to venture no farther if
the waterman would have done it.</p>
<p>"When I was on shore, the man said to me, 'Master, you have been
us'd to the sea, I don't doubt; why you can sleep in a storm
without any concern, as if you did not value your life; I never
carry'd one in my life that did so; why, 'twas a wonder we had not
founder'd.' 'Why,' says I, 'friend, for that you know I left it all
to you; I did not doubt but you would take care of yourself;' but
after that I told him my other reason for it, the fellow smil'd,
but own'd the thing was true, and that he was the more cautious a
great deal, for that I took no thought about it; and I am still of
opinion, that the less frighted and timorous their passengers are,
the more cautious and careful the watermen are, and the least apt
to run into danger; whereas, if their passengers appear frighted,
then the watermen grow sawcy and audacious, show themselves
vent'rous, and contemn the dangers which they are really exposed
to."&mdash;p. 130.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not bound to suppose that this is plain relation of
matter of fact, any more than the <i>History of Robinson
Crusoe</i>; but it is a graphic sketch of life and manners worth
the notice of those who study such things. It forms at least a
little contribution to the history of travelling in England. A
passenger who had just landed from a Gravesend boat, to pursue his
journey by land, might well be thankful to "be received in a coach"
like that which had been started at York near half a century
before.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE SECOND EDITION OF MR. CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK OF
LONDON.</h3>
<p>Mr. Cunningham's work on London is a book of such general
interest, that the additions and corrections, which I shall
continue from time to time to offer to your readers, will not, I
think, be deemed impertinent or trifling. Let it not be imagined,
for one single instant, that I wish to depreciate Mr. Cunningham's
labours. On the contrary, his book is one of the most delightful
publications relative to our great city which we possess. And let
me candidly say, if I were to select only half-a-dozen volumes for
my own reading, <i>Cunningham's Handbook of London</i> would most
assuredly be one of that number.</p>
<p>The quaint and learned old Fuller, in his address to the
<i>Worthies of England</i>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The bare skeleton of time, place, and person, must be fleshed
with some pleasant passages; and to this intent I have purposely
interlaced (not as meat but as condiment) many stories, so that the
reader, if he do not arise <i>religiosior</i> or <i>doctior</i>,
with more piety or learning, at least he may depart
<i>jucundior</i>, with more pleasure and lawful delight."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remark has been well understood by Mr. Cunningham, whose
pleasant quotations, and literary and artistic recollections, have
made his book a <i>readable</i> one to the many, and an instructive
companion for the <i>initiated</i>.</p>
<p>The "bare skeleton" sometimes wants "fleshing," and hence the
following list of additions and corrections:</p>
<p>1. <i>Dobney's</i>, or, more correctly, <i>D'Aubigney's Bowling
Green</i>, was a celebrated place of amusement "more than sixty
years since." It is now occupied by a group of houses called
<i>Dobney's Place</i>, near the bottom of Penton street, and almost
opposite to the Belvidere Tavern and Tea Gardens.</p>
<p>2. <i>Bridge Street, Westminster.</i> The Long Wool-staple was
on the site of this street. Henry VIII., in 1548, founded, "in the
Long Wool-staple," St. Stephen's Hospital, for eight maimed
soldiers, who had each a convenient room, and received an allowance
of 5<i>l.</i> a year from the exchequer. It was removed in 1735,
and eight almshouses rebuilt in St. Anne's Lane, bearing the
inscription "Wool-staple Pensioners, 1741." In 1628, in the
Overseer's books of St. Margaret's is rated in the Wool-staple
"Orlando Gibbons ij <i>d.</i>"</p>
<p>3. <i>Campden House, Kensington.</i> Built by Sir Baptist Hickes
in 1612; pulled down about 1827. Nicholas Lechmere, the eminent
lawyer, was residing here when he was created a peer.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Back in the dark, by Brompton Park,</p>
<p>He turned up thro' the Gore,</p>
<p>So slunk to <i>Campden House</i> so high,</p>
<p>All in his coach and four."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Swift's Ballad of <i>Duke and no Duke</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>4. <i>Finch's Grotto.</i> A place of amusement, similar to
Vauxhall Gardens, much in vogue at the end of the last century. The
"Grotto Gardens," as they were sometimes called, were situated
partly in Winchester Park, or the Clink, and partly in the parish
of St. George, Southwark.</p>
<p>5. <i>Leicester Square.</i> Mr. Cunningham does not mention the
fine house of Sir George Savile, in this square. It was
subsequently Miss Linwood's <i>Exhibition of Needlework</i>; and
has latterly been used as a concert-room, casino, &amp;c. The
statue in the centre of the square is George I., not George II.</p>
<p>6. <i>Thavie's Inn.</i> A small brass plate fixed up against the
first house on the west side, has the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thavie's Inn, founded by John Thavie, Esquire, in the reign of
Edward the Third; Adjudged to be extra-parochial, in the Court of
King's Bench, Guild-hall, in the causes Fraser against the Parish
of St. Andrew, Holborn, on the 7th day of July, 1823, and Marsden
against the same parish, on the 17th day of October, 1826. This
memorial of the antiquity and privileges of this inn, was erected
during the Treasurership of Francis Paget Watson, Esq., Anno Dom.
MDCCCXXVII."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. <i>Old Bailey.</i> Peter Bales, the celebrated writing master
of Queen Elizabeth's reign, was master of a school "at the upper
end of the <i>Old Bailey</i>" in 1590. It was here he published his
first work, entitled, <i>The Writing School Master</i>.</p>
<p>8. <i>Islington.</i> During the reign of James I. and Charles
I., Islington was a favourite resort, on account of its rich
dairies. In that part of the manor of Highbury at the lower end of
Islington, there were, in 1611, eight inns principally supported by
summer visitors. See <i>Nelson's History of Islington</i>, p. 38,
4to., 1811.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;Hogsdone, <i>Islington</i>, and Tothnam Court,</p>
<p>For cakes and creame had then no small resort."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Wither's <i>Britain's Remembrancer</i>, 12mo. 1628.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>9. <i>Seven Dials.</i> The Doric column with its "seven dials,"
which once marked this locality, now "ornaments" the pleasant
little town of Walton-on-Thames.</p>
<p>10. <i>Mews (the King's).</i> The fore-court of the royal mews
was used in 1829 for the exhibition of a "monstrous whale." The
<i>building</i> (which stood upon the site of the National Gallery)
was occupied, at the same time, by the <i>Museum of National
Manufactures</i>. The "Museum" was removed, upon the pulling down
of the mews, to Dr. Hunter's house in Leicester Square, and was
finally closed upon the establishment of the <i>Royal Polytechnic
Institution</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham, in his <i>Chronology</i>, says the mews was
taken down in 1827. In the body of the book he gives the date,
perhaps more correctly, 1830.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id=
"page212"></a>{212}</span>
<p>11. <i>Brownlow Street, Holborn.</i> This should be "Brownlow
Street, <i>Drury Lane</i>;" George Vertue the engraver was living
here in 1748.</p>
<p>12. <i>White Conduit House.</i> The anonymous author of <i>The
Sunday Ramble</i>, 1774, has left us the following description of
this once popular tea-gardens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The garden is formed into several pleasing walks, prettily
disposed; at the end of the principal one is a painting, which
serves to render it much larger in appearance than it really is;
and in the middle of the garden is a round fish-pond, encompassed
with a great number of very genteel boxes for company, curiously
cut into the hedges, and adorned with a variety of Flemish and

<p>"White Conduit Loaves" were for a long time famous, and before
the great augmentation in the price of bread, during the
revolutionary war with France, they formed one of the regular
"London cries."</p>
<p>13. <i>Vauxhall Gardens.</i> A curious and highly interesting
description of this popular place of amusement, "a century ago,"
was printed in 1745, under the title of <i>A Sketch of the
Spring-Gardens, Vaux-hall, in a letter to a Noble Lord</i>, 8vo. My
copy is much at Mr. Cunningham's service for any future edition of
his <i>Handbook</i>.</p>

<h3>DEVOTIONAL TRACTS BELONGING TO QUEEN KATHERINE PARR.</h3>
<p>In your Number for August 10th, I observe an inquiry regarding a
MS. book of prayers said to have belonged to Queen Katherine Parr.
Of the book in question I know nothing, but there has lately come
into my possession a volume of early English printed devotional
works, which undoubtedly has belonged to this Queen. The volume is
a small duodecimo, bound red velvet, with gilt leaves, and it has
had ornamental borders and clasps of some metal, as the impressions
of these are still distinctly visible upon the velvet covering. The
contents of this volume are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. "A sermon of Saint Chrysostome, wherein besyde that it is
furnysshed with heuenly wisedome and teachinge, he wonderfully
proueth that No man is hurted but of hym-selfe: translated into
Englishe by the floure of lerned menne in his tyme, Thomas Lupsete,
Londoner, 1534."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the bottom of this title-page is written, in the well-known
bold hand of Katherine Parr,&mdash;"Kateryn the Quene, K.P.," with
the equally well-known flourish beneath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. "A svvete and devovte sermon of Holy Saynet Ciprian of
mortalitie of man. The rules of a Christian life made by Picus,
erle of Mirandula, both translated into Englyshe by Syr Thomas
Elyot, Knyght. Londini, Anno verbi incarnati MDXXXIX.</p>
<p>3. "An exhortation to yonge men, &amp;c., by Thomas Lupsete,
Londener, 1534.</p>
<p>4. "A treatise of charitie, 1534.</p>
<p>5. "Here be the Gathered Counsales of Sainete Isidorie, &amp;c.,
1539.</p>
<p>6. "A compendious and a very fruitful treatise teaching the waye
of dyenge well, written to a frende by the floure of lerned men of
his tyme, Thomas Lupsete, Londoner, late deceassed, on whose sowle
Jesu have mercy. 1541."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost all these treatises are printed by Thomas Berthelet. I
know not if any of these treatises are now scarce. On the fly-leaf
opposite the first page we find the following scriptural sentences,
which are, in my opinion, and in that of others to whom I have
shown the book, evidently written by the hand of the queen.</p>
<p>It will be only necessary to give the first and last of these
sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Delyte not in &THORN;e multytude of ungodly men, and haue no
pleasure in &THORN;em, for they feare not God.</p>
<p>"Refuse not &THORN;e prayer of one yt is in trouble, and turne
not away thy face from the nedye."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need not quote more; but on the opposite side of the fly-leaf
are some verses of a different character, and which I suspect to be
from the royal pen of Henry VIII. The writing is uncommonly
difficult to decypher, but it bears a strong resemblance to all
that I have seen of Henry's handwriting. A portion of the verses,
as far as I can make them out, are here subjoined:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Blush not, fayre nimphe, tho (nee?) of nobell blod,</p>
<p>I fain avoutch it, and of manners good,</p>
<p>Spottles in lyf, of mynd sencere and sound,</p>
<p>In whoam a world of vertues doth abowend,</p>
<p>And sith besyd yt ye lycens giv withall</p>
<p>Set doughts asyd and to some sporting fall,</p>
<p>Therefoor, suspysion, I do banyshe thee"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then follows a line I cannot decypher, and at the bottom of the
page is</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"You will be clear of my suspysion."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Are these verses from some old poet, or are they composed as
well as written by the royal tyrant? for no other would, I think,
have addressed such lines to "Kateryn the Quene."</p>
<p>I have only to add that the volume was given me by the sister of
the late President of the English college at Valladolid, and that
he obtained it during his residence in Spain. It is not unlikely it
may have been carried thither by some of the English Catholics, who
resorted to that country for education. In 1625 it seems to have
belonged to John Sherrott.</p>
<p>I should be glad of any information about the verses.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR CHEAP BOOKS OF REFERENCE.</h3>
<p>Although your space is generally devoted to the higher and more
curious inquiries respecting antiquities and literature, I am sure
you will not grudge a little room for facilitating and improving
the means of popular information and instruction.</p>
<p>For every man, almost in any station in society, I submit that
the followings works for reference are indispensable, in the most
convenient corner or shelf of his library:&mdash;1. A Biographical
Dictionary. 2. A Gazetteer. 3. A Statistical or Commercial
Dictionary. With works of that description the public have been
very indifferently supplied during the last thirty years: at least,
at the <i>moderate prices</i> calculated to bring them within the
reach of students in humbler life, forming the great mass of
readers. Mr. Constable, of Edinburgh, published in 1817 an abridged
Gazetteer, price 18<i>s.</i>, but there has been no such work
since. Mr. A.K. Johnston's <i>Geographical Dictionary</i>, at
36<i>s.</i>, lately published, supplies to a certain class of
readers one of the works wanted.</p>
<p>I beg to suggest a few observations for the improvement of works
of this description through your valuable channel.</p>
<p>I. I submit that none of the dictionaries of reference now
specified should be published without promise of a <i>periodical
supplement</i> every five or seven years, containing later matter
and intelligence. For example, how easily could this be given in
the case of a Biographical Dictionary! Say that such a work has
been published in 1830 (which, it is believed, is the date of
Gorton's excellent <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>), the compiler of
a supplement has only to collect and arrange monthly or annual
obituaries of the common magazines since 1830 to make a good and
useful supplemental volume.</p>
<p>II. I would suggest to skilful authors and booksellers
publishing Biographical Dictionaries to follow the French and
American custom of including in them the more eminent
<i>contemporary</i> living characters. That would add greatly to
the use of the book; and the matter could easily be collected from
the current Books of Peerage and Parliamentary Companions, with aid
from the numerous magazines as to distinguished literary men.</p>
<p>III. The supplements for Gazetteers could be easily compiled
from the <i>parliamentary papers</i> and magazines of the day. I
would refer particularly to the supplements published by Mr.
McCulloch to his <i>Commercial Dictionary</i> as an example to be
followed; while the conduct lately adopted in the new edition of
Maunder's <i>Biographical Treasury</i> should be avoided. The old
edition of that collection consisted of 839 pages, and it is
believed it was <i>stereotyped</i>. A new edition, or a new issue,
of the old 839 pages was lately published, the same as the original
dictionary, with a supplement of 72 pages. That is not sold
separately; so that the holders of the old edition must purchase
the whole work a <i>second</i> time in 1850, at 10<i>s.</i>, to
procure the supplement. The public should not encourage such a
style of publication. Any one might publish a supplemental
dictionary since 1836, which would equally serve with the old
edition. This hint is particularly addressed to Mr. Charles
Knight.</p>
<p>These hints are offered to the publishers and encouragers of
<i>popular</i> works for general readers, at economical prices; and
they might be extended. For example, dictionaries of medicine for
family use have great sale. Sometimes, it is believed, they are
stereotyped. Why should not later practice and discoveries be
published in a cheaper <i>supplement</i>, to preserve the value of
the original work? Thus, in my family, I use the excellent
<i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Popular Medicine</i> published by Dr. Murray
in 1842; but on looking into it for "Chloroform" and "Cod Liver
Oil," no such articles are to be found, as they were not known in
1842. The skilful will find many other omissions.</p>
<p>IV. There might be a greater difficulty in constructing a
popular commercial or statistical dictionary, at a moderate price,
to be supplied with supplements at later intervals. But even as to
these, there is a good model in Waterston's <i>Small Dictionary of
Commerce</i>, published in 1844, which, with a supplement, might
afford, for a few shillings, to give all the later information
derived from the free-trade measures and extension of our colonies.
Waterston's original work is advertised often for sale at
10<i>s.</i> or 12<i>s.</i>, and a supplement at 3<i>s.</i> would
bring it within the reach of the great bulk of readers.</p>
<p>These suggestions are offered without the slightest intention to
depreciate or disparage the greater and more elaborate works of Mr.
McCulloch, and others who compile and publish works worthy of
reference, and standards of authority among men of highest science.
No man who can afford it would ever be without the latest edition
(without the aid of supplements) of large works; but it is manifest
that there has been a great neglect to supply the mass of readers
in ordinary circumstances with books of common reference, at
moderate prices; and I hope that some publishers of enterprise and
sagacity will see it to be their interest to act on the advice now
offered.</p>

<h3>RIB, WHY THE FIRST WOMAN FORMED FROM.</h3>
<p>Allow me to request a place for the following curious and quaint
exposition of the propriety of the selection of <i>the rib</i> as
the material out of which our first mother Eve was formed; and the
ingenious illustration which it is made to afford of the relation
between wife and husband.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id=
"page214"></a>{214}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thirdly, God so ordered the matter betwixt them, that this
adh&aelig;sion and agglutination of one to the other should be
perpetuall. For by taking a bone from the man (who was <i>nimium
osseus</i>, exceeded and was somewhat monstrous, by one bone too
much) to strengthen the woman, and by putting flesh in steede
thereof to mollifie the man, he made a sweete complexion and temper
betwixt them, like harmony in musicke, for their amiable
cohabitation.</p>
<p>"Fourthly, that bone which God tooke from the man, was from out
the midst of him. As Christ wrought saluation <i>in medio
terr&aelig;</i>, so God made the woman <i>&egrave; medio viri</i>,
out of the very midst of man. The <i>species</i> of the bone is
exprest to be <i>costa</i>, a rib, a bone of the side, not of the
head: a woman is not <i>domina</i>, the ruler; nor of any anterior
part; she is not <i>pr&aelig;lata</i>, preferred before the man;
nor a bone of the foote; she is not <i>serva</i>, a handmaid; nor
of any hinder part; she is not <i>post-posita</i>, set behind the
man: but a bone of the <i>side</i>, of a middle and indifferent
part, to show that she is <i>socia</i>, a companion to the husband.
For <i>qui junguntur lateribus, socii sunt</i>, they that walke
side to side and cheeke to cheeke, walke as companions.</p>
<p>"Fifthly, I might adde, a bone from vnder the arme, to put the
man in remembrance of protection and defense to the woman.</p>
<p>"Sixthly, a bone not far from his heart to put him in minde of
dilection and loue to the woman. Lastly, a bone from the left side,
to put the woman in minde, that by reason of her frailty and
infirmity she standeth in need of both the one and the other from
her husband.</p>
<p>"To conclude my discourse, if these things be duely examined
when man taketh a woman to wife, <i>reparat latus suum</i>, what
doth he else but remember the maime that was sometimes made in his
side, and desireth to repaire it? <i>Repetit costam suam</i>, he
requireth and fetcheth back the rib that was taken from him,"
&amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;From pp. 28, 30, of "<i>Vitis Palatina</i>, A
sermon appointed to be preached at Whitehall, upon Tuesday after
the marriage of the Ladie Elizabeth, her Grace, by the B. of
London. London: printed for John Bill, 1614."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The marriage actually took place on the 14th of February, 1612.
In the dedication to the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles I.,
the Bishop (Dr. John King) hints that he had delayed the
publication till the full meaning of his text, which is Psalm
xxviii. ver. 3, should have been accomplished by the birth of a
son, an event which had been recently announced, and that, too, on
the very day when this Psalm occurred in the course of the Church
service.</p>
<p>The sermon is curious, and I may hereafter trouble you with some
notices of these "Wedding Sermons," which are evidently
contemplated by the framers of our Liturgy, as the concluding
homily of the office for matrimony is by the Rubric to be read "if
there be no sermon." It is observable that the first Rubric
especially directs that the woman shall stand on the man's left
hand. Any notices on the subject from your correspondents would be
acceptable.</p>
<p>In the first series of Southey's <i>Common Place Book</i>, at
page 226., a passage is quoted from Henry Smith's <i>Sermons</i>,
which dwells much upon the formation of the woman from <i>the
rib</i> of man, but not in such detail as Bishop King has done.
Notices of the Bishop may be found in Keble's edition of
<i>Hooker</i>, vol. ii. pp. 24, 100, 103. It appears that after his
death it was alleged that he maintained Popish doctrines. This his
son, Henry King, canon of St. Paul's, and Archdeacon of Colchester,
satisfactorily disproved in a sermon at Paul's Cross, and again in
the dedication prefixed to his "<i>Exposition upon the Lord's
Prayer</i>," 4to., London, 1634. See Wood's <i>Athen&aelig;
Oxon.</i>, fol. edit. vol. ii. p. 294.</p>
<p>As for the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth, afterwards
celebrated for her misfortunes as Queen of Bohemia, it was
celebrated in an epithalamium by Dr. Donne, <i>Works</i>, 8vo.
edit. vol. vi. p. 550. And in the Somer's <i>Tracts</i>, vol. iii.,
pp. 35, 43., may be found descriptions of the "<i>shewes</i>," and
a poem of Taylor the Water Poet, entitled "Heaven's Blessing and
Earth's Joy," all tending to show the great contemporary interest
which the event occasioned.</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES</h3>
<p><i>Cinderella, or the Glass Slipper.</i>&mdash;Two centuries ago
furs were so rare, and therefore so highly valued, that the wearing
of them was restricted by several sumptuary laws to kings and
princes. Sable, in those laws called <i>vair</i>, was the subject
of countless regulations: the exact quality permitted to be worn by
persons of different grades, and the articles of dress to which it
might be applied, were defined most strictly. Perrault's tale of
<i>Cinderella</i> originally marked the dignity conferred on her by
the fairy by her wearing a slipper of <i>vair</i>, a privilege then
confined to the highest rank of princesses. An error of the press,
now become inveterate, changed <i>vair</i> into <i>verre</i>, and
the slipper of <i>sable</i> was suddenly converted into a
<i>glass</i> slipper.</p>
<p class="author">Jarltzberg.</p>
<p><i>Mistletoe on Oaks.</i>&mdash;In Vol. ii., p. 163., I observed
a citation on the extreme rarity of <i>mistletoe on oaks</i>, from
Dr. Giles and Dr. Daubeny; and with reference to it, and to some
remarks of Professor Henslow in the <i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i>, I
communicated to the latter journal, last week, the fact of my
having, at this present time, a bunch of that plant growing in
great luxuriance on an oak aged upwards of seventy years.</p>
<p>I beg leave to repeat it for the use of your work, and to add,
what I previously appended as likely to be interesting to the
arch&aelig;ologist of Wales or the Marches, that the oak bearing it
stands about half a mile N.W. of my residence here, on the earthen
mound of Badamscourt, once a moated <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page215" id="page215"></a>{215}</span> mansion of the Herberts, or
Ab-Adams, of Beachley adjacent, and of Llanllowell.</p>
<p class="author">George Ormerod.</p>
<p>Sedbury Park, Chepstow.</p>
<p><i>Omnibuses.</i>&mdash;It may be interesting to your readers at
a future time to know when these vehicles, the use of which is
daily extending, were introduced into this country; perhaps,
therefore, you will allow me to state how the fact is. Mr. C.
Knight, in his <i>Volume of Varieties</i>, p. 178., observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Omnibus was tried about 1800, with four horses and six
wheels; but we refused to accept it in any shape till we imported
the fashion from Paris in 1830."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Shillibeer, of the City Road, the inventor of the patent
funeral carriage, in his evidence before the Board of Health on the
general scheme for extra-mural sepulture, incidentally mentions
that he</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Had had much experience in cheapening vehicular transit, having
originated and established the Omnibus in
England."&mdash;<i>Report</i>, p. 124., 8vo. ed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">Arun.</p>
<p><i>Havock.</i>&mdash;Havock is a term in our ancient English
military laws: the use of it was forbidden among the soldiery by
the army regulations of those days; so in the Ordinances des
Batailles in the ninth year of Richard II, art. x.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Item, que nul soit si hardi de crier havoick sur peine d'avoir
la teste coupe."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was properly a punishable offence in soldiers; havock being
the cry of mutual encouragement to general massacre, unlimited
slaughter, that no quarter should be given, &amp;c. A tract on "The
office of the constable and Mareshall in the tyme of Warre,"
contained in the black book of the Admiralty, has this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Also, that no man be so hardy to crye havock upon peyne that he
that is begynner shall be deede therefore: and the remanent that
doo the same, or follow, shall lose their horse and harneis ... and
his body in prison at the king's will."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this appears to answer well to the original term, which is
taken from the ravages committed by a troop of wild beasts, wolves,
lions, &amp;c., falling on a flock of sheep. But some think it was
originally a hunting term, importing the letting loose a pack of
hounds. Shakspeare combines both senses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Cry havock! and let slip the dogs of war."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a copy of Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> before me, I find</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"HAVOCK (haroc, Sax.), waste; wide and general devastation."
<i>Spenser</i>.</p>
<p>"HAVOCK, <i>interj</i>, a word of encouragement to slaughter."
<i>Shakspeare</i>.</p>
<p>"TO HAVOCK, <i>v. a.</i>, to waste; to destroy; to lay waste."
<i>Spenser</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">Jarltzberg.</p>
<p><i>Schlegel on Church Property in England.</i>&mdash;Fr.
Schlegel, in his <i>Philosophy of History</i>, says, p. 403., "in
England and Sweden church property remained inviolate:" what the
case may be in Sweden I do not know, but it appears strange that a
man of such general knowledge as F. Schlegel should make such an
assertion as regards England.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>P. MATHIEU'S LIFE OF SEJANUS.</h3>
<p>In a letter from Southey to his friend Bedford, dated Nov. 11,
1821 (<i>Life and Correspondence</i>, vol. v. p. 99.), he desires
him to inform Gifford that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In a volume of tracts at Lowther, of Charles I.'s time, I found
a life of Sejanus by P.M., by which initials some hand, apparently
as old as the book, had written Philip Massinger. I did not read
the tract, being too keenly in pursuit of other game; but I believe
it had a covert aim at Buckingham. I have not his Massinger, and,
therefore, do not know whether he is aware that this was ever
ascribed to that author; if he is not, he will be interested in the
circumstance, and may think it worthy of further inquiry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As others may be led by this hint to enter on such an inquiry, I
would suggest that it may save much trouble if they first satisfy
themselves that the <i>Life of Sejanus</i> by P. Mathieu may not
have been the tract which fell in Southey's way. It is to be found
in a volume entitled</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Unhappy Prosperity</i>, expressed in the History of
&AElig;lius Selanus and Philippa the <i>Catanian</i>, with
observations upon the fall of Sejanus. Lastly, Certain
Considerations upon the life and Services of <i>Monsieur</i>
Villeroy, translated out of the original [French] by <i>S'r T.
H.</i>[<i>awkins</i>], <i>second edition</i>, 12'o. London,
1639."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was just eleven years after Buckingham met his fate at the
hands of Felton. How long the interval between the first and this,
the second edition, may have been, I cannot tell. Nor do I know
enough of the politics of the time to determine whether anything
can be inferred from the fact that the translation is dedicated to
William Earl of Salisbury, or to warrant me in saying that these
illustrations of the fate of royal favourites may have been brought
before the English public with any view to the case of George
Villiers. A passage, however, in Mathieu's dedication of the
original "to the king," seems to render it not improbable,
certainly not inapplicable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You (Sir) shall therein [in this history] behold, that <i>a
prince ought to be very carefull to conserve his authority entire.
Great ones</i> [court favourites] <i>here may learne</i>, it is not
good to play with the generous <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page216" id="page216"></a>{216}</span> Lyon though he suffer it,
and that <i>favours are precipices for such as abuse them</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having referred to this work of Mathieu's, I shall feel obliged
to any of your correspondents who will favour me with a notice of
it, or of the author.</p>

<h3>THE ANTIQUITY OF SMOKING.</h3>
<p>I feel much interested in the Query of your correspondent Z.A.Z.
(Vol. ii., p. 41.) I had a "Query" something similar, with a "Note"
on it, lying by me for some time, which I send you as they
stand.&mdash;Was not smoking in use in England and other countries
before the introduction of tobacco? Whitaker says, a few days after
the tower of Kirkstall Abbey fell, 1779, he</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Discovered imbedded in the mortar of the fallen fragments
several little smoking pipes, such as were used in the reign of
James I. for tobacco; a proof of a fact <i>which has not been
recorded</i>, that, prior to the introduction of that plant from
America, the practice of inhaling the smoke of some indigenous
plant or vegetable prevailed in England." (<i>Loidis and
Elmete</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allowing, then, pipes to have been coeval with the erection of
Kirkstall, we find them to have been used in England about 400
years before the introduction of tobacco. On the other hand, as Dr.
Whitaker says, we find <i>no record</i> of their being used, or of
smoking being practised; and it is almost inconceivable that our
ancestors should have had such a practice, without any allusion
being made to it by any writers. As to the antiquity of smoking in
Ireland, the first of Irish antiquaries, the learned and respected
Dr. Petrie, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The custom of smoking is of much greater antiquity in Ireland
than the introduction of tobacco into Europe. Smoking pipes made of
bronze are frequently found in our Irish <i>tumuli</i>, or
sepulchral mounds, of the most remote antiquity; and similar pipes,
made of baked clay, are discovered daily in all parts of the
island. A curious instance of the <i>bathos</i> in sculpture, which
also illustrates the antiquity of this custom, occurs on the
monument of Donogh O'Brien, king of Thomond, who was killed in
1267, and interred in the Abbey of Corcumrac, in the co. of Clare,
of which his family were the founders. He is represented in the
usual recumbent posture, with the short pipe or <i>dudeen</i> of
the Irish in his mouth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Anthologia Hibernica</i> for May 1793, vol. i. p.
352., we have some remarks on the antiquity of smoking "among the
German and Northern nations," who, the writer says, "were clearly
acquainted with, and cultivated tobacco, which they smoked through
wooden and earthen tubes." He refers to Herod. lib. i. sec. 36.;
Strabo, lib. vii. 296.; Pomp. Mela 2, and Solinus, c. 15.</p>
<p>Wherever we go, we see smoking so universal a practice, and
people "taking to it so naturally," that we are inclined to believe
that it was always so; that our first father enjoyed a quiet puff
now and then; (that, like a poet, man "nascitur non fit" a smoker);
and that the soothing power of this narcotic tranquillised the soul
of the aquatic patriarch, disturbed by the roar of billows and the
convulsions of nature, and diffused its peaceful influence over the
inmates of the ark. Yes, we are tempted to spurn the question, When
and where was smoking introduced? as being equal to When and where
was <i>man</i> introduced? Yet, as some do not consider man as a
smoking animal "de natu et ab initio," the question may provoke
some interesting replies from your learned correspondents.</p>

<h3>SIR GREGORY NORTON, BART.</h3>
<p>I am desirous to be informed of the date and particulars of the
above baronetcy having been created. In <i>The Mystery of the good
old Cause briefly unfolded</i> (1660), it is stated, at p. 26.,
that Sir Gregory Norton, Bart. (one of the king's judges), had
Richmond House, situated in the <i>Old</i> Park, and much of the
king's goods, for an inconsiderable value. Sir Gregory Norton has a
place also in <i>The Loyal Martyrology</i> of Winstanley (1665), p.
130.; and also in <i>History of the King-killers</i> (1719), part
6. p. 75. It is unnecessary to refer to Noble's <i>Regicides</i>,
he having simply copied the two preceding works. Sir Gregory died
before the Restoration, in 1652, and escaped the vindictive
executions which ensued, and was buried at Richmond in Surrey.
There was a Sir <i>Richard</i> Norton, Bart., of Rotherfield,
<i>Hants</i> (Query Rotherfield, <i>Sussex</i>, near Tunbridge
Wells), who is mentioned by Sylvanus Morgan in his <i>Sphere of
Gentry</i>; but he does not record a Sir Gregory. Nor does the
latter occur in a perfect collection of the knights made by King
James I., by J.P. (Query John Philipot?), London, Humphrey Moseley,
1660, 8vo. I have examined all the various works on extinct and
dormant baronetcies ineffectually. In the <i>Mercurius Publicus</i>
of Thursday, 28th June, 1660, it appears that on the preceding
Saturday the House of Commons settled the manor of Richmond, with
house and materials, purchased by Sir Gregory Norton, Bart., on the
queen (Henrietta Maria) as part of her jointure.</p>

<p><i>Saffron-bag.</i>&mdash;Having lately read Sir E.B. Lytton's
novel of <i>The Caxtons</i>&mdash;to which I must give a passing
tribute of admiration&mdash;I have been a good deal puzzled, first,
to ascertain the meaning, and, second, the origin of the
<i>saffron-bag</i> of which he speaks so much. I have asked many

<p><i>Portrait (Unknown).</i>&mdash;A very carefully painted
portrait, on an oak panel, has been in the possession of my family
for many years, and I should be much pleased if any of your
correspondents could enable me to identify the personage.</p>
<p>The figure, which is little more than a head, is nearly the size
of life, and represents an elderly man with grey hair and a long
venerable beard: the dress, which is but little shown, is black. At
the upper part of the panel, on the dexter side, is a shield,
bearing these arms:&mdash;Argent on a fess sable between three
crosses pat&eacute;es, Or, as many martlets of the last. Above the
shield is written "In cruce glorior." I have searched in vain for
those arms. On the prints published by the Society of Antiquaries,
of the funeral of Abbot Islip, is one nearly similar,&mdash;the
field ermine on a fess between three crosses pat&eacute;es, as many
martlets. The colours are not shown by the engraver. A manuscript
ordinary, by Glover, in my possession, contains another, which is
somewhat like that on the picture, being&mdash;Argent on a fess
engrailed sable, bearing three crosses pat&eacute;es, Gules, as
many martlets on the field. This is there ascribed to "Canon
George." It is very probable that the gold crosses on the white
field was an error of the portrait painter.</p>
<p>The size of the oak panel, which is thick, is seventeen inches
wide, and twenty-two in height. The motto is in a cursive hand,
apparently of about the time of Edward VI.</p>

manuscript which contains numerous tunes of the time of Queen
Elizabeth, one of which is stated in a recent hand to be the "tune
of <i>Concolinel</i> mentioned by Shakspeare;" but the old index,
if there was one that indicated this, is now missing. My reason for
writing to you is to ask whether Dr. Rimbault, or any of your other

to ascertain whether my MS. really contains that tune. It certainly
does contain several others noticed by Shakspeare.</p>

<p><i>The Norfolk Dialect.</i>&mdash;Mr. Dickens' attempt to give
interest to his new novel by introducing this dialect would have
been even more successful had he been more familiar with the
curious peculiarities of that east-coast language. Many of the
words are, I believe, quite peculiar to Norfolk and Suffolk, such
as, for instance, the following:</p>

<p><i>Mawther</i>, a girl, a wench.</p>
<p><i>Gotsch</i>, a stone jug.</p>
<p><i>Holl</i>, a dry ditch.</p>
<p><i>Anan? An?</i> an interrogation used when the</p>
<p>speaker does not understand a question put to him.</p>
<p><i>To be muddled</i>, to be distressed in mind.</p>
<p><i>Together</i>, an expletive used thus: where are</p>
<p>you going <i>together?</i> (meaning several
persons)&mdash;what</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>DERIVATION OF NEWS.</h3>
<p>I have no wish to prolong the controversy on this word, in which
I feel I, at least, have had my share. I beg room, however, for an
observation on one or two very pertinent remarks by Mr. Singer.</p>
<p>In the course of this argument I have seen that if <i>news</i>
were originally a plural noun, it might be taken for an ellipsis of
<i>new-tidings</i>. My objection to this would be twofold. First,
that the adjective <i>new</i> is of too common use, and, at the
same time, too general and vague to form an ellipsis intelligible
on its first application; and, secondly, that the ellipsis formed
of <i>new-tidings</i> would be found to express no more than
<i>tidings</i>, still requiring the <i>new</i>, if the idea of
<i>new</i> were required, as in the instance Mr. Singer cites of
<i>new newes</i>.</p>
<p>I would not pretend to determine whether the word were taken
from the High German or the Dutch; but Mr. Singer's remark, that
our language has derived scarcely anything from the former, brings
back the question to the point from which I originally started.
That there was a political and commercial connexion between the two
countries, I suppose there can be no doubt and such, I imagine,
never existed without leaving its marks on languages so near
akin.</p>
<p>Taking up Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i> by accident a day or two
ago, I turned to the word, which I there find as derived from
Newes, <i>Teut</i>.; Bailey using the term <i>Teutonic</i> for
German.</p>
<p>I think I shall express the feelings of the majority of your
readers in saying that nothing could be more acceptable or valuable
to the consideration of any etymological question than the remarks
of Mr. Singer.</p>
<p class="author">Samuel Hickson.</p>
<p>I have read with much interest the respective theories of the
derivation of <i>news</i>, and it seems to me that Mr. Hickson's
opinion must give way to an excellent authority in questions of
this kind, Dr. Latham, who says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some say, <i>this news</i> IS good in which case the word is
singular. More rarely we find the expression, <i>these news</i> ARE
good; in which case the word "news" is plural. In the word "news",
the -<i>s</i> (unlike the -<i>s</i> in <i>alms</i> and
<i>riches</i>) is no part of the original singular, but the sign of
the plural, like the -<i>s</i> in "trees." Notwithstanding this, we
cannot subtract the <i>s</i>, and say "new," in the same way that
we <i>can</i> form "tree" from "trees." Hence the word "news" is,
in respect to its original form, plural; in respect to its meaning,
either singular or plural, most frequently the
former.&mdash;<i>Eng. Grammar</i>, p. 62.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above extract will probably suffice to show the true state
of the case, and for information on similar points I would refer
your readers to the work from which the above extract is taken, and
also to that on <i>The English Language</i>, by the same
author.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Swords worn in public</i> (Vol. i., p. 415.; vol. ii. p.
110.).&mdash;I am surprised that the curious topic suggested by the
Query of J.D.A. has not been more satisfactorily answered.
Wedsecuarf's reply (Vol. ii., p. 110.) is short, and not quite
exact. He says that "Swords ceased to be worn as an article of
dress through the influence of Beau Nash, and were consequently
first out of fashion at Bath;" and he quotes the authority of Sir
Lucius O'Trigger as to "wearing no swords <i>there</i>." Now, it
is, I believe, true that Nash endeavoured to discountenance the
wearing swords at Bath; but it is certain that they were commonly
worn twenty or thirty years later.</p>
<p>Sir Lucius O'Trigger talks of Bath in 1774, near twenty years
after Nash's reign, and, even at that time, only says that swords
were "not worn <i>there</i>"&mdash;implying that they were worn
elsewhere; and we know that Sheridan's own duel at Bath was a
rencontre, he and his adversary, Mathews, both wearing swords. I
remember my father's swords hung up in his dressing-room, and his
telling me that he had worn a sword, even in the streets, so late
as about 1779 or 1780. In a set of characteristic sketches of
eminent persons about the year 1782, several wear swords; and one
or two members of the House of Commons, evidently represented in
the attitude of speaking, have swords. I have seen a picture of the
Mall in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id=
"page219"></a>{219}</span> St. James's Park, of about that date, in
which all the men have swords.</p>
<p>I suspect they began to go out of common use about 1770 and were
nearly left off in ordinary life in 1780; but were still
occasionally worn, both in public and private, till the French
Revolution, when they totally went out, except in court dress.</p>
<p>If any of your correspondents who has access to the Museum would
look through the prints representing out-of-doors life, from
Hogarth to Gilray, he would probably be able to furnish you with
some precise and amusing details on this not unimportant point in
the history of manners.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p><i>Quarles' Pension</i> (Vol. ii., p. 171.).&mdash;There should
have been added to the reference there given, viz. "Vol. i., p.
201." (at which place there is no question as to Quarles'
<i>pension</i>), another to Vol. i., p. 245., where that question
is raised. I think this worth noting, as "Quarles" does not appear
in the Index, and the imperfect reference might lead inquirers
astray. It seems very curious that the inquiry as to the precise
meaning of Pope's couplet has as yet received no explanation.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p><i>Franz von Sickingen</i> (Vol. i., p. 131.).&mdash;I regret
that I cannot resolve the doubt of H.J.H. respecting Albert Durer's
allegorical print of <i>The Knight, Death, and the Devil</i>, of
which I have only what I presume is a copy or retouched plate,
bearing the date 1564 on the tablet in the lower left-hand corner,
where I suppose the mark of Albert Durer is placed in the
original.</p>
<p>I should, however, much doubt its being intended as a portrait
of Sickingen, and I can trace no resemblance to the medal given by
Luckius. I believe the conjecture originated with Bartsch, in his
<i>Peintre Graveur</i>, vol. vii. p. 107. Schoeber, in his <i>Life
of Durer</i>, p. 87., supposes that it is an allegory of the nature
of a soldier's life.</p>
<p>It was this print that inspired La Motte Fouqu&eacute; with the
idea of his <i>Sintram</i> as he thus informs us in the postscript
to that singularly romantic tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some years since there lay among my birth-day presents a
beautiful engraving of Albert Durer. A harnessed knight, with an
oldish countenance, is riding upon his high steed, attended by his
dog, through a fearful valley, where fragments of rock and roots of
trees distort themselves into loathsome forms; and poisonous weeds
rankle along the ground. Evil vermin are creeping along through
them. Beside him Death is riding on a wasted pony; from behind the
form of a devil stretches over its clawed arm toward him. Both
horse and dog look strangely, as it were infected by the hideous
objects that surround them; but the knight rides quietly along his
way, and bears upon the tip of his lance a lizard that he has
already speared. A castle, with its rich friendly battlements,
looks over from afar, whereat the desolateness of the valley
penetrates yet deeper into the soul. The friend who gave me this
print added a letter, with a request that I would explain the
mysterious forms by a ballad.... I bear the image with me in peace
and in war, until it has now spun itself out into a little
romance."</p>

production of Raphael Mengs, and was purchased for the price of
three hundred guineas of Sir James Thornhill, who painted the
figure of the founder over the altar, the ceiling, and the figures
between the windows. There may be other paintings by earlier
masters on so interesting subject, but none can surpass this of
Raphael Mengs in the truthfulness of what he has here delineated.
The exact size of the picture I do not recollect, but it cannot be
less than ten feet high.</p>

<p><i>Countess of Desmond</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 153. 186.).&mdash;In
reply to K., I have an impression that Horace Walpole has a kind of
dissertation on the <i>Old Countess of Desmond</i>, to whom his
attention was directed by her being said to have danced with
Richard III. Having no books at hand, I cannot speak positively;
but if K. turns to Walpole's <i>Works</i>, he will see whether my
memory is correct. I myself once looked, many years ago, into the
subject, and satisfied myself that the great age attributed to
<i>any</i> Countess of Desmond must be a fable; and that the
portrait of her (I think, at Windsor) was so gross an imposition as
to be really that of an old man. I made a "Note"&mdash;indeed
many&mdash;of the circumstances which led me to this conclusion;
but they are at this moment inaccessible to me. I venture however,
now that the question is revived, to offer these vague suggestions.
By and by, if the subject be not exhausted, I shall endeavour to
find my "Notes," and communicate them to you. I wonder the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id=

incredulity as to the length of her life.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas Herbert's Memoirs</i> (Vol. ii., p.
140.).&mdash;The information MR. GATTY wishes for, he will find in
Dr. Bliss's edition of the <i>Athen&aelig;</i>, vol. iv. p. 18. He
will perform an acceptable service to historical inquirers, if he
will collate the printed memoir with the MS. in the possession of
his friend, and give to the world such passages, if any, as have
not been hitherto published.</p>
<p class="author">&Delta;.</p>
<p><i>Alarum</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 151. 183.).&mdash;There can be no
doubt that the word <i>alarm</i> (originally French) comes from the
warning war-cry <i>&agrave; l'arme</i>. So all the French
philologists agree; and the modern variance of <i>aux armes</i>
does not invalidate so plain an etymology. When CH. admits that
there can be no doubt that <i>alarm</i> and <i>alarum</i> are
identical, it seems to one that <i>cadit questio</i>,&mdash;that
all his doubts and queries are answered. I will add, however, that
it appears that in the words' original sense of an <i>awakening
cry</i>, Shakspeare generally, if not always, spelled it
<i>alarum</i>. Thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ring the <i>alarum</i> bell!"&mdash;<i>Macbeth</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"&mdash;Murder</p>
<p>"<i>Alarum'd</i> by his sentinel the wolf."</p>
<p><i>Macbeth</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When she speaks, is it not an <i>alarum</i> to love?"</p>
<p><i>Othello</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But when he saw my <i>best-alarum'd</i> spirits roused</p>
<p>to the encounter."&mdash;<i>Lear</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In all these cases <i>alarum</i> means incitement, not
<i>alarm</i> in the secondary or metaphorical sense of the word,
which has now become the ordinary one. In truth, the meanings,
though of identical origin, have become almost contradictions: for
instance, in the passage from <i>Othello</i>, an "alarum to
love"&mdash;incitement to love&mdash;is nearly the reverse of what
an "alarm to love" would be taken to mean.</p>

<p class="author">GRIFFIN.</p>
<p><i>Martinet</i> (Vol. ii., p. 118.).&mdash;There is no doubt the
term <i>martinet</i> is derived from the general officer <i>M. de
Martinet</i> indicated by MR. C. FORBES, and who was, as Voltaire
states, celebrated for having restored and improved the discipline
and tactics of the French army; whence very strict officers came to
be called <i>martinets</i>: but is it also from this restorer of
discipline that the name of what we call <i>cat-o'-nine-tails</i>
is in French <i>martinet</i>? This is rather an interesting Query,
considering how severely our neighbours censure our use of that
auxiliary to discipline.</p>

<p><i>"Yote" or "Yeot"</i> (Vol. ii., p. 89.).&mdash;You may inform

<p><i>Wood-carving, Snow Hill</i> (Vol. ii., p. 134.).&mdash;The

narrating his fables. It is or rather <i>was</i>, a work of some
merit, and is, as A.C. observes, "worth preserving;" but, alas! of
this there is but little chance. The house in question (No. 41.
Skinner Street), and also the one adjoining, have been tenantless
for many years; they belong to two old ladies, who also own the two
deserted houses at the corner of Stamford Street, Blackfriars Road.
It is scarcely necessary to speak of the now somewhat picturesque
condition of the houses alluded to in either locality, for the
pitiably dilapidated condition of them all must have been matter of
remark for many years past to any one at all acquainted with
London. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id=
"page221"></a>{221}</span> The house, 41. Skinner Street, is also
worthy of remark from another circumstance. It was formerly
occupied by William Godwin, the well-known author of <i>Caleb
Williams, Political Justice</i>, &amp;c. It was here he opened a
bookseller's shop, and published his numerous juvenile works, under
the assumed name of Edward Baldwin.</p>
<p class="author">E.B. PRICE.</p>
<p><i>Waltheof</i> (Vol. ii, p. 167.).&mdash;I believe that
Waltheof (or Wallef, as he is always styled in Doomsday Book) never
appeared at the court of William the Conqueror in the character of
an envoy; but in 1067, little better than six months after the
first landing of the Normans, we find him, in conjunction with
Edgar Atheling and others, accompanying the Conqueror in his
triumphal return to Normandy, as a hostage and guarantee for the
quiescence of his countrymen. At this period, it is probable he
might have first become acquainted with Judith; but this must rest
on conjecture. At all events, we have the authority of William of
Malmsbury for saying that Waltheof's marriage did not take place
until the year 1070, soon after his reconciliation with the king on
the banks of the Tees. Your correspondent errs in ascribing 1070 as
the date of Waltheof's execution; the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>
distinctly states May 31st, 1076, as the date of his death; while
the chronicle of Mailros, and Florence of Worcester, assign it to
the preceding year: in which they are followed by Augustin Thierry.
T.E.L.L. has also fallen into an error as to the cause of
Waltheof's execution, which he states arose from his participation
in a conspiracy at York. Now the crime for which he was accused,
and condemned (on the evidence of his wife), was his inviting over
the Danes to the invasion of England. This was the primary cause;
although his being present at the celebrated marriage-feast at
Norwich was doubtless a secondary one. According to Thierry, he
left two children by Judith.</p>

<p><i>The Dodo</i> (Vol. i., pp. 261. 410.).&mdash;I have the
pleasure to supply Mr. Strickland with the elucidation he desires
in his Query 7., by referring to Hyde, <i>Historia Religionis Vet.
Persarum</i>, p. 312.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Under the Rose</i>" (Vol. i., p. 214.).&mdash;I find the
three following derivations for this phrase in my
note-book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I. "The expression, 'under the rose,' took its origin," says
Jenoway, "from the wars between the Houses of York and Lancaster.
The parties respectively swore by the red or the white rose, and
these opposite emblems were displayed as the <i>signs of two
taverns</i>; one of which was by the side of, and the other
opposite to, the Parliament House in Old Palace Yard, Westminster.
Here the retainers and servants of the noblemen attached to the
Duke of York and Henry VI. used to meet. Here also, as disturbances
were frequent, measures either of defence or annoyance were taken,
and every transaction was said to be done 'under the rose;' by
which expression the most profound secrecy was implied."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>II. According to others, this term originated in the fable of
Cupid giving the rose to Harpocrates, the god of silence, as a
bribe to prevent him betraying the amours of Venus, and was hence
adopted as the emblem of silence. The rose was for this reason
frequently sculptured on the ceilings of drinking and feasting,
rooms, as a warning to the guests that what was said in moments of
conviviality should not be repeated; from which, what was intended
to be kept secret was said to be held "under the rose."</p>
<p>III. Roses were consecrated as presents from the Pope. In 1526,
they were placed over the goals of confessionals as the symbols of
secrecy. Hence the origin of the phrase "Under the Rose."</p>

<p><i>Ergh, Er, or Argh.</i>&mdash;Might not these words (queried
by T.W., Vol. ii. p 22.) be corruptions of "<i>burgh</i>,"
aspirated <i>wurgh</i>, and the aspirate then dropped; or might not
<i>ark, argh</i>, &amp;c., be corruptions of "<i>wark</i>:" thus
Southwark, commonly pronounced <i>Southark</i>? I merely offer this
as a conjecture.</p>
<p class="author">JARLTZBERG.</p>
<p><i>Royal Supporters</i> (Vol. ii., p. 136.).&mdash;E.C. asks
when and why the unicorn was introduced as one of the royal
supporters. It was introduced by James VI. of Scotland when he
ascended the throne of England, on account of the Scottish royal
supporters being two unicorns rampant argent, crowned with
imperial, and gorged with antique, crowns, with chains affixed to
the latter passing between their forelegs and reflexed over their
backs, unguled, armed, and crined, all or; the dexter one embracing
and bearing up a banner of gold charged with the royal arms; the
sinister, another banner azure, charged with the cross of St.
Andrew, argent. Queen Elizabeth had used as supporters, dexter, a
lion rampant gardant, crowned; and sinister, a dragon rampant, both
or. She also used a lion ramp. gardant crowned, and a greyhound,
both or. James adopted as supporters, dexter, a lion ramp. gardant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id=
"page222"></a>{222}</span> crowned with the imperial crown, or;
sinister, an unicorn argent, armed, crined, unguled, gorged with a
coronet composed of crosses pat&eacute;es, and fleurs-de-lis, a
chain affixed thereto passing between its forelegs, and reflexed
over the back, all or. These have been used as the royal supporters
ever since their first adoption, with but one exception, and that
is in the seal of the Exchequer, time of Charles I., where the
supporters are an antelope and stag, both ducally collared and
chained.</p>

<p><i>The Frog and the Crow of Ennow</i>.&mdash;In answer to M.
(Vol. ii., p. 136.), I send you the edition of "the frog and the
crow" which I have been familiar with since childhood. I can give
you no history of it, save that it is tolerably well known in
Lancashire, and that the <i>point</i> consists in giving a scream
over the last "oh!" which invariably, if well done, elicits a start
even in those who are familiar with the rhyme, and know what to
expect.</p>

<p>The moral is obvious, and the diction too recent for the song to

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>It would, we think, be extremely difficult to find any subject
upon which persons, otherwise well informed, were so entirely
ignorant, until the appearance of Mrs. Jameson's <i>Sacred and
Legendary Art</i>, as the one upon which that lady treated in those
ably written and beautifully illustrated volumes. It seemed as if
the Act of Henry VIII., which declared that the name and
remembrance of Thomas &agrave; Becket should be erased from all
documents, had had the effect of obliterating from all memories not
only the often puerile, often offensive stories of the
legend-mongers, but, with them, all remembrance of those holy men
of old, whose piety towards God, and love for their fellow men,
furnished example for all succeeding ages. To readers of all
classes Mrs. Jameson opened up a new and most interesting subject:
to lovers of Art almost a new world, from the light which her
learning and criticism threw upon its master-pieces. What wonder is
it, then, that the success of her <i>Sacred and Legendary Art</i>,
confined as the two volumes necessarily were to legends of angels
and archangels, evangelists and apostles, the Fathers, the
Magdalene, the patron saints, the virgin patronesses, the martyrs,
bishops and hermits, and the patron saints of christendom, should
have led Mrs. Jameson to continue her labours? The first part of
such continuation is now before us, under the title of <i>Legends
of the Monastic Orders</i>: and most fitting it is that the three
great divisions of the regular ecclesiastics should be thus
commemorated, since of them Mrs. Jameson aptly remarks, that while
each had a distinct vocation, there was one vocation common to
all:&mdash;"The Benedictine Monks instituted schools of learning;
the Augustines built noble cathedrals; the Mendicant Orders founded
hospitals: <i>all</i> became patrons of the Fine Arts on such a
scale of munificence, that the protection of the most renowned
princes has been mean and insignificant in comparison." Nor is this
their only claim; for the earliest artists of the Middle Ages were
monks of the Benedictine Order. "As architects, as glass painters,
as mosaic workers, as carvers in wood and metal, they were the
precursors of all that has since been achieved in Christian Art:
and if so few of these admirable and gifted men are known to us
individually and by name, it is because they worked for the honour
of God and their community, not for profit, nor for reputation."
The merits of Mrs. Jameson's first series were universally
acknowledged. The present volume may claim as high a meed of
praise. If possible, it exceeds its predecessors in literary
interest, and in the beauty of the etchings and woodcuts which
accompany it. As a handbook to the traveller who wanders through
the treasuries of Art, it will be indispensable; while to those who
are destined not to leave their homes it will be invaluable, for
the light it throws upon the social condition of Europe in those
ages in which the monastic orders had their origin. It is a volume
highly suggestive both of Notes and Queries, and in such forms we
shall take occasion to return to it.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
